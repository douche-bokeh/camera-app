# Douche Bokeh - The Camera App

## What's with the name?

¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

## Goal

We want it to be a troll app, sort of. Well I think that's how you're supposed
to describe it. Anyway Wantei got this great idea - use the bokeh effect on everything
except one subject.

Imagine that - group photo and everything is blurred out except you.

A narcissist's favorite photo app? Perhaps. Perhaps.

## How to get started

1. Clone this repo. You'll get the `develop` branch because that's the default branch.
2. This repo uses `git flow`. New installations of git come with `git flow`.
3. Make the master branch: `git branch master`
4. Run: `git flow init`
5. Accept the defaults
6. Done
